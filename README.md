# ODI Publishing, 11ty sandbox

DRAFT

This is a working copy of odi-publishing-11ty-starter-kit.

* Used for testing the publishing pipeline without effecting production sites.
* Can be used for demos, training, review, and testing pipeline errors and reliability.
* The `odi-publishing-11ty-starter-kit` is intended to act as a "quick-start" for setting up a new static site using the ODI Publishing system, and up-to-date design system components. 
* We currently support integration with the WordPress REST API through a middleware service called "wordpress-to-github."

# Local development
